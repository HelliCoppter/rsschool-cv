### About me

Hi, my name is Alexander Fufachev! I've never done CV before so please don't judge me strongly. I'm from Russia. I was born in 1992 in a little village north of Kirov district. After graduating high school I got to university where I studied programming, circuit engineering, hardware and more other things. I've ended study and I've got a qualification as engineer. For a notice I haven't had practice of engineering work.

After serving in the army I returned to home and decided radically change my life. I moved to Sochi where I've worked as bartender and continue working right now.
It's difficult to explain how it happened but anyway this is a part of my life.

Okay, that was little part of my biography but is now more important what I know and what I can do. Well, I'd love to tell about. At one time with my studies I worked as project manager for a Event- company. What I did:
- *organize evets, meetings, actions*
- *social media marketing*
- *PR*
- *management of working group*

I worked in such a way four years. Since 2016 I work in the hospitality industry. I've got there many different helpful soft-skills. Notably:
- *I'm responsible for my work and my job*
- *I study quick*
- *Results-focused mindset*
- *Conscientiousness*

So let's get to the point. I'm learning programming half year. I'm learning and so much wanna be the Front-end developer. I realized I like programming. At this time I have learned `HTML`, `CSS`, `preprocessors CSS`, `Git`, how working with `Webpack` and `Gulp`, basic knowledge about `MVC`. According to the tests my English level is intermediate.

My purpose at this moment is finish the course and get a job.
